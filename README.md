*"Physiotherapy through a fun motion sensitive game that is so smooth you may even say its mayonnaise"*

This hack is the culmination of a web application and a hardware based hack. It uses a MYO armband as a connection between motion and gaming. The EMG sensors pick up subtle hand gestures which are then translated into commands within a game. The game itself is a very natural plat-former with support for two characters (and two armbands!). The main point is to assist people undergoing rehabilitation in parts of the arm. The contraction and expansion of certain muscle groups associated with the gestures help accelerate this process! The armband transmits these signals to a Node.js server which looks for certain gestures and activates the corresponding actions in the game. This project also incorporates from a physiotherapist who gave insights on which muscles require more attention. It also won the Hacker's Choice award and the 'Objectively Human' (By Liberty Mutual) at the MadHacks hackathon held in Madision, Wisconsin.
